Here's a cleaned-up plan that uses a **simplified state machine** architecture instead of complex effect queues.

**Note**: Throughout implementation, use the vb-implementation directory as a behavioral reference for card effects and rule implementations. The VB code has working implementations of all card effects and e

# ✅ Phase 0 — Repo & Workspace (COMPLETED)

* ✅ Create single TypeScript package with clear module structure
  `/src/engine`, `/src/ui`, `/src/bot`, `/src/types`, `/src/cards`
* ✅ Enable TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier
* ✅ Add Vitest for testing + coverage

* ✅ Test cards selected for architecture validation

# ✅ Phase 1 — Core Types & State Machine (COMPLETED)
