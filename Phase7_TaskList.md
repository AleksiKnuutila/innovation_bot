### Task 7f.3: Performance and Stability Testing
- **Description**: Ensure all effects work efficiently
- **Files**: Performance test suite
- **Output**: Performance benchmarks
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 7f.2

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test effect execution speed
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns
- [ ] Test stability with long games
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. **Start Simple, Build Complexity**
- Begin with basic draw/score effects (Writing, The Wheel)
- Progress to conditional effects (Code of Laws, Clothing)
- Tackle complex demand effects last (Oars, City States)

### 2. **Leverage Existing Primitives**
- Use `drawCard`, `scoreCard`, `meldCard` extensively
- Create new primitives only where clear patterns emerge
- Avoid duplicating logic across similar effects

### 3. **Follow Established Patterns**
- Use the callback-based state machine consistently
- Keep effect state simple and serializable
- Handle edge cases gracefully (empty hands, no valid targets)

### 4. **Test Incrementally**
- Test each effect as it's implemented
- Don't wait until all effects are done to start testing
- Use existing test patterns as templates

### 5. **Reference VB Implementation**
- Use VB code as behavioral reference
- Don't copy VB logic directly (different architecture)
- Focus on understanding the intended behavior

### 6. **Handle Edge Cases**
- Empty hands, boards, score piles
- Invalid card selections
- Impossible demands
- Icon counting edge cases

### 7. **Performance Considerations**
- Avoid unnecessary state cloning
- Minimize effect state complexity
- Use efficient data structures
- Profile complex effects

## Risk Mitigation

### **High Risk Areas**:
- Complex demand effects with multiple choices
- Effects that modify game state during execution
- Icon counting and splay mechanics
- Achievement claiming during effects

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
- Extensive testing of complex effects
- Clear state machine patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

### **Phase 7 Complete When**:
- [ ] **Phase 7g**: All architectural simplification tasks completed
- [ ] All 105 cards have working effect implementations
- [ ] All effects follow established architecture patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
- [ ] VB implementation behavioral correctness validated
- [ ] All FAQ clarifications implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### **Phase 7g Success Criteria**:
- [x] Simple effects reduced by 60-70% in code size
- [x] Registry system unified and confusion eliminated
- [x] Primitives used consistently across all effects
- [x] Event system boilerplate eliminated
- [x] All existing tests still pass
- [x] Architecture ready for Age 3+ implementation
- [x] **ADDITIONAL**: 7 effects now use simplified pattern (Writing, The Wheel, Sailing, Calendar, Fermenting, Domestication, Canal Building)
- [x] **ADDITIONAL**: Hardcoded initial state mappings reduced from 25 to 18
- [x] **ADDITIONAL**: All test expectations updated for simplified effects

**Phase 7g Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED WITH ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS** - All architectural simplification tasks completed successfully, plus additional effect simplifications

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 7a (Database)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 7b (Strategy)**: 3-4 days  
- **Phase 7c (Primitives)**: 5-6 days
- **Phase 7d (Implementation)**: 40-50 days
- **Phase 7g (Architectural Simplification)**: 7-10 days ⚠️ **NEW PRIORITY**
- **Phase 7e (Testing)**: 10-12 days
- **Phase 7f (Validation)**: 6-9 days

**Total Estimated Effort**: 74-95 days (approximately 3.5-4.5 months)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Phase 7g must be completed before continuing with Age 3+ cards

## Dependencies

- **External**: VB implementation reference
- **Internal**: Existing engine architecture, primitive functions
- **Testing**: Vitest framework, existing test patterns
- **Documentation**: FAQ clarifications, card database
