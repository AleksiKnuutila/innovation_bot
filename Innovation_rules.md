Innovation is a game of civilization building through technologies, ideas, and ingenuity. Starting in the Stone Age, you will choose the innovations that define your people’s destiny through history from the humble beginnings of The Wheel and Clothing, to Gunpowder, Democracy, and Combustion, all the way to Satellites and The Internet. Each of these will give your civilization a specific ability. Some will allow you to advance through the ages faster, others will help build your infrastructure, and yet more will give you the ability to attack your rivals.

Each of these innovations is depicted in the game by a card, and all are unique. There are no maps or pieces to move around, as the cards provide all of the action and scorekeeping in the game. A card’s primary use is as an innovation, played face-up in front of you to be used for effect, but cards can also wind up face-down in your score pile or as achievements, representing your civilization’s power, influence, and legacy.

# Game setup

1) Split the base set cards into their ten supply piles, arranged like a clock as shown above.

2) Without looking, draw one base card from each supply pile of ages 1-9, and place them in the center as normal Achievements.

3) Place the base set’s five Special Achievements nearby.

4) Perform the setup steps for each expansion you choose to play with.

5) Each player draws two cards from the age 1 supply pile, and all players simultaneously choose one to be the first card on their board. The other card is kept to form each player’s initial hand.

6) The player who chose the card whose title comes first alphabetically goes first. The first player (or the first two in a four or more player game) will take only one action instead of two on their initial turn. Subsequent turns are normal.

# # ANATOMY OF A CARD

CARD TITLE

Each of the 105 innovations is unique.

VALUE

Matches the age of the supply pile it came from.

DOGMA EFFECTS

Each card you play grants you abilities called dogma effects. Some are demands that attack other players. Others help you advance your civilization. A featured icon precedes each effect.

ICONS

Each card has four potential icon locations. Icons help you defend against demands, and share in other players’ dogma effects.

Here are the names for the standard icons in _Innovation:

- **Leaf**
- **Bulbs**
- **Crown**
- **Castle**
- **Factory**
- **Clock**

CARD IMAGE

One of the four icons on each card is an image depicting the innovation. It does not provide any benefit.

# # CARD ICONS

**Basic:** There are six basic icon types that appear on cards in Innovation. Three of them can be on cards in any age, but the other three are restricted to certain periods of time.

Basic icons help you share other players’ dogma effects and issue demands.

# YOUR CIVILIZATION

As you play, you will accumulate cards of five different colors in an area in front of you called your board. Your most important cards are the top cards of each color, as they can be activated for their effects through the Dogma action. Cards that you cover up over time are still useful, because some effects will allow you to splay a color in a direction. Splaying will reveal additional icons from your covered up cards.

Your board consists of all the cards you have put into play.

Visible basic icons will help you share in other players’ actions, demand from opponents, and also defend against their demands.

Your score pile contains face-down cards. Each card is worth its value (the age number) in points.

Achievements are one way to win in Innovation. Once claimed, they can never be taken away from you.

# Your turn

On each turn, you must take two actions. There are four types of action: Draw, Meld, Dogma, and Achieve. You can perform the same action twice, or take two different actions.

If you receive a free action from an effect or rule, it does not count as one of your two per turn.

## Draw action

A Draw action lets you draw one card from a supply pile into your hand. You draw from the age matching your highest value top card. The value of a card is the age number in the top right corner.

If all the base set cards in a supply pile are gone, that age is considered to be empty. When an age is empty, you draw from the next higher age instead. If multiple ages are empty, continue skipping as necessary.

If you have to skip age 10 and try to draw an age 11 card that doesn’t exist, the game ends immediately.

If you are playing with expansions, each has its own rule governing how its cards are drawn.

## DRAW ACTION EXAMPLE

You take a Draw action, in the example to the right. Your highest top card is a 2. Even though a 4 is visible on a splayed card, it is not at the top of the purple stack and therefore is not a top card. You attempt to draw a 2, but age 2 is empty. Instead, you draw a 3.

### SKIPPING AGES

If you need to draw a card from an empty age’s supply pile through a dogma effect or other rule, you skip to the next available pile in the same way. If a card instructed you to "draw a 4" or "draw and meld a 5" in the example to the right, you would draw a 6 instead, skipping the empty ages 4 and 5.

If a card instructs you to take a card of a specific value from any place other than a supply pile, you only do so if that value of card is present. Do not skip to the next available card.

## Meld action

Choose a card from your hand and place it on your board. If you have cards of that card’s color already, stack it on top of them. Continue the splay direction of the pile, if its cards are already splayed.

## ACHIEVE ACTION

You may only take an Achieve action if you are eligible to claim one of the available achievements. To be eligible for an achievement, you must satisfy both of two conditions. First, your score must be at least five times the age number of the achievement. Your score is the total value of all cards in your score pile. Second, you must have a top card on your board of equal or higher value to the age number of the achievement.

When you take the Achieve action and claim an achievement you are eligible for, place it under the right side of your reference card. Your score pile only tells whether or not you are eligible, you do not spend cards from it when taking an Achieve action.

You can only be eligible to claim an achievement if it is available in the center of the table. Once another player has an achievement, it cannot be claimed by anyone else.

_**Example**: You, in the supply-pile example above, have 15 points (4 + 4 + 4 + 3), and the 1 achievement has already been claimed. Your highest top card is a 2. You are only eligible to claim the 2 achievement, even though you have enough points for the 3, as you must satisfy both conditions. The 1 has already been claimed. You take an Achieve action and claim the 2._

### #### WINNING THE GAME

Achievements are one way to win in Innovation. In the base game, with two players, you win if you get six achievements.

## DOGMA ACTION

### CHOOSE A CARD

To start a Dogma action, you must choose one of your top cards to activate. This represents your civilization turning its main focus to one of the innovations you have discovered. All of the effects on the card you choose will be executed, regardless of anything else that happens to it or other cards during the action.

### SHARING/VULNERABILITY

Each dogma effect is preceded by a small copy of the icon most prevalent on the card, indicating that it is the featured icon for the card. Before any effects are executed, each player counts how many of that icon are visible on their board. Any player that has at least as many as you is **eligible to share** in the use of your innovation. Any opponent that has fewer than you is **vulnerable to demands** from your innovation.

Eligibility for sharing and vulnerability to demands are only determined once during a Dogma action. Even if cards on players’ boards change during the action, they remain eligible or vulnerable for its duration.

### EXECUTE EFFECTS

Many cards have multiple effects. You must execute all of them during a Dogma action. Always complete an effect entirely before you move on to the next effect.

Before you execute a non-demand effect (any effect that does not start with ‘I Demand’), each player who is eligible to share must also do so. Starting to your left and going clockwise, each of them must follow the effect’s instructions. Then, you must perform them.

Demand effects are in darker boxes and all start with ‘I demand.’ Read demand effects out loud to make it clear what your opponents must do. In clockwise order, each vulnerable opponent follows the instructions. Other opponents ignore it.

If you can only perform part of an effect, do as much as you can and ignore the rest. If any effect forces you to choose between multiple cards (ex: your ‘highest top card’, and two cards are tied), you decide which of your cards is affected.

### SHARING DRAW BONUS

If one or more players that were eligible to share your effects did so, then you take one free Draw action after the Dogma action is complete. This only occurs if an opponent’s use of the shared effect caused a change in the game’s state. A change is one or more cards being revealed, or moved from one location to another (ex: melding, splaying in a new direction, scoring, etc)

You do not get a free Draw action due to players affected by demands.

## KEYWORDS

**Actions (Draw, Meld, Achieve):** A dogma effect that instructs you to draw, meld, or achieve does not count as an action of that type. It does not count as one of your two actions per turn. It does not trigger expansion draws or foreshadow promotion.

**Bottom:** The bottom card in your stack of a color. If you have only one card of a color, it is both the bottom and top card of that color.

**Card Image:** The image in a hexagon on a card, depicting the innovation. The location of the image affects which splays are most effective, and are used by the Artifacts of History draw rule.

**Draw and X:** Many dogma effects instruct you to draw and tuck, draw and meld, or draw and score a card of a specific value. First, draw the card, skipping empty ages as appropriate. Then, perform the action (tuck it, score it, meld it, etc) on the card you drew. ‘Draw and reveal’ effects place the card in your hand, unless the effect takes it away afterward.

**Exchange:** Swap cards from the two locations given, even if one half of the exchange is empty. An exchanged card has not been "scored," (or "melded", "drawn", etc) for the purposes of special achievements or karma effects.

**Execute each of its non-demand dogma effects. Do not share them:** Do not share effects on the targeted card, regardless of icon count. The effects can still impact other players (ex: Rocketry), just not by sharing.

**Highest / Lowest:** Refers to the value (age number) of the cards in question.

**Non-demand effect:** Any dogma effect that does not begin with "I Demand." (or "I Compel" with Artifacts of History)

**Remove:** A removed card is placed in the game box, out of play.

**Return:** A returned card is placed at the bottom of its supply pile, face down. If multiple cards are returned at once, choose the order. If you return a base card of an empty age, it is no longer empty.

**Score:** To score a card, place it in your score pile, face-down. Your score is the total value of all the cards in your score pile.

**Top:** The top card of each color is the card on top of its stack. If you have only one card of a color, it is both the bottom and top card of that color.

**Transfer:** Move a card from one area in play to another. Transferring a card does not count as melding, achieving, scoring, etc.

**Type:** The type of a card is which expansion it comes from.

**Tuck:** To tuck a card, place it on the bottom of the matching color pile, continuing a splay if possible. If no cards of its color are on your board, it forms a new pile.

**Visible:** A card is visible if it is a top card, or if it is in a splayed stack and you can see any part of it. An icon or echo/inspire effect is visible if it is on a top card or can be fully seen due to a splay.

**Value:** The value of a card is its age number. If a card refers to the value of something you don’t have, like your top purple card if you have none, treat the value as 0.

# SPLAYING

Many dogma effects will instruct you to splay a color in a direction. At any given time, a color is either unsplayed, splayed left, splayed right, or splayed up.

To splay a color, take the top card and slide it in the direction indicated, revealing one icon if splaying left, two icons if splaying right, and three icons if splaying up. If there are more than two cards, repeat the process so that all cards in the color are splayed. If the color was already splayed, unsplay it before splaying it in the new direction. If a color contains zero or one card, it is always considered unsplayed. If a splayed color is reduced to zero or one card, it does not remember that it was previously splayed.

# SCORE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS

Over the course of the game, you will accumulate cards in your score pile through dogma effects. Each card in your score pile is worth points equal to its value (the age number). When you slide them under your reference card, the number will be visible in the top left. Your score is the total value of all these cards. When playing with expansions, your score may be increased by visible bonus icons. To the right is an example score pile with 15 points:

Nine normal achievements are available to start the game, one of each from ages 1 through 9. You can claim an achievement with the Achieve action, if you have enough points and a top card of the achievement’s value or higher. Once gone, they are not replenished. You do not have to claim them in order, and on occasion it is makes strategic sense to take a higher achievement first.

Special achievements can be claimed at any time, even in the middle of an effect, or during another player’s turn. If you meet the conditions for one of them, take it immediately. Like normal achievements, once a special achievement is claimed by a player, it is no longer available for others to claim. In the rare case that two players simultaneously become eligible to claim a special achievement, the tie is broken in turn order going clockwise, with the current player winning ties.

# WINNING AND GAME END

There are three ways to win a game of Innovation: by achievements, score, or special card effect.

To win via achievements, you need to claim a number of achievements depending on how many players are in the game. For a two player game with just the base set, 6 achievements are needed. For each extra player, subtract one. For each expansion included, add one. A minimum of 4 achievements are needed, regardless of player count.

To win by score, the game must end due to a player attempting to draw a card higher than age 10. This can happen if the age 10 supply pile runs out, or through various dogma effects. The moment the card would be drawn, the game ends immediately. In this case, each player’s current score is more important than achievements, as time has passed by their relevance. The player (or team) with the highest current score wins. If tied, most achievements wins. If still tied, the game is a draw.

Several cards can end the game early. Some allow you to win given a certain condition, which if satisfied ends the game immediately. Others let "the single player with the most X" win. These also end the game immediately, but only if there is no tie for X. If there is a tie, the effect is ignored entirely. In a team game, this grants victory to all players on the team.

# INFORMATION VISIBILITY

- You may never look at the identity of normal achievement cards, even if you have achieved them.
- You can always look at the cards in your hand, score pile, forecast, and board (even if covered up).
- You can always count and see the value and type of cards in each supply pile, each hand, and each score pile.
