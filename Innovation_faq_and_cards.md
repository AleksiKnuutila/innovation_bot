## FAQ

## The two unwritten golden rules

Innovation has two unwritten golden rules which are extremely useful in resolving many questions.

## 'Do all you can, ignore the rest'

Remember: 'Do all you can, ignore the rest!'. When activating a dogma, you (and sharing opponents) should complete as much of each of the dogma effects as possible. If you cannot fulfill a part of an effect, you should skip it and continue with the rest of the effect, unless otherwise stated.

## Some examples:

- If a dogma effect prompts you to meld (or score, or tuck) a card from your hand and your hand is empty, the meld (or score, or tuck) does not apply.
- If a dogma effect is looking for X cards that answer a specific criterion, and there are less than X such cards, use just those cards that are available.

In case you cannot seem to resolve this rule with a specific card, consult the card's FAQ entry as it might have a more specific explanation.

## Read the effect aloud

The terms 'I' and 'You' in dogma effects change meaning between I Demand and non-I Demand dogmas. Reading the effect aloud solves the discrepancy. In a non-I Demand dogma effect, the card is

talking to you. In a demand effect, you are talking to the attacked player. For example, the first dogma effect of Oars says,

[Castle]: I demand you transfer a card with a [Crown] from your hand to my score pile! If you do, draw a 1!

When read aloud, you address your opponent who has less [Castle] icons than you. 'Listen, chum! I demand you transfer a card with a [Crown] from your hand to my score pile'. Your opponent shuffles through his hand and quickly complies, handing you Sailing (which indeed has a [Crown]). 'If you do, draw a 1!'. Your opponent transferred a card to your score pile so he now draws a 1.

Generally, in I Demand dogma effects, 'You' refers to opponents while 'I' refers to the owner of the cards. In non-I Demand dogma effects, 'You' refers to the player using the dogma effect.

## General game play

## I've been playing a few games, and one specific card always winsâ€¦

Innovation has multiple routes to victory. While some cards (or strategies) may be considered more powerful than others, there are no silver bullets that automatically win the game. Check the FAQ to make sure you got the effect of the card correctly; and if you're sure you're playing it right, try to think 'outside of the box' on how to defeat it. An often forgotten rule is that you cannot achieve a numbered achievement unless you have a top card whose age is equal to or greater than the achievement.

## What are the hexagonal icons that appear on all cards?

These icons are visual representations of what the card is; you can think of them as adding flavor to the game. Importantly, their purpose is to vary how effective splays are in different directions. A hexagon in the top left, for example, means that the most effective splay for that card is 'Up'.

## What is the number inside the circle on the back of the cards?

This is an aid of how many points you need to claim an achievement from that age (five times the age). It has no other game effect. The actual point value of the card is its age, not the circled number.

## Can I examine the cards in my score pile? How about cards on my board, beneath the top card of each pile?

You can look at anything on your board except for the achievement cards. For opponent's boards, you can only examine top cards and splayed icons.

## Can I look through my opponent's table cards?

No. You can only examine top cards and splayed icons.

What is the hand size limit? 105.

(Clarification: There are 105 cards in the game. There is no hand size limit).

## When does the game end?

The game ends when one of the following three conditions is met:

1. A player achieves the sixth achievement in a two players game, the fifth achievement in a three players game, or the fourth achievement in a four players game. That player immediately wins. The game cannot end in a tie in this situation.
2. A player attempts to draw a [10] (either as an action, as a Dogma draw effect, or as a Dogma draw and X effect), and the [10] deck is empty. In this case, the player with the highest score immediately wins. In case of a tie, the player with more achievements wins.  If still tied, victory is shared.
3. A dogma effect prompts for the game to end. If the effect states that the player with the most of some value wins, and no single player satisfies the condition (either no players, or more than one player, satisfy the condition) the game continues. The following cards can end the game:
- Empiricism (age 8).
- Collaboration (age 9).
- A.I. (age 10).
- Bioengineering (age 10).
- Globalization (age 10).
- Self Service (age 10).

## Actions

- The first player's turn is a half turn, with one action instead of two.
- o In a four player game, the two first players' first turns are half turns.

## Meld

## Do I keep the cards I melded to decide on starting player?

Yes, these cards are melded and form the first card for each player's board.

## Can I meld a card from an earlier age on top of a card from a later age?

Yes, you can choose (or be forced by a dogma effect) to meld an earlier age card.

## What happens when I meld on top of a splayed deck?

You continue the splay in the same direction.

## Draw

## How do I know which age pile to draw from?

Examine your board and find the highest top card (if your board is empty, the highest top card is zero). Draw a card from that pile. If that pile is empty, find the lowest non-empty pile that is higher than the pile you wanted to draw from, and draw from that pile. In other words, keep trying to draw one pile higher, until you find a non empty pile.   If this causes you to be unable to draw (by going above 10), the game is over.

## Achieve

## What are the requirements for achieving?

In order to claim a numbered achievement, you must have the required number of points, and one of the top cards on your board must be of that age or higher. Special achievements are claimed immediately (not using an achieve action) when their condition is fulfilled.

## Do the number achievements have to be claimed in order?

No. You can claim any achievement for which you fulfill the requirements.

## Can you claim more of than one of the same achievement? (Same special achievement or same age specific achievement?)

No. There is only one copy of each achievement, once each is claimed the player who has it keeps it. No other players can claim it again.

## Dogma

- Dogma effects are always done in the order written on the card. This is especially important for claiming special achievements (for example, if a card is melded and its icons allow you to satisfy Empire, and then another card is melded on top of it as part of the dogma effect, you are allowed to claim Empire in between the melds).
- I Demand effects are done in turn order, starting from the opponent to the left of the current player.
- If a card is removed from play mid dogma (covered, returned, returned, etc.) you still complete all of the effects on it.

## Anatomy of a Dogma Action

1. Choose a top card on your board.
2. Determine the featured icon.  Count up the number of visible icons of that type on your board, and on each other player's board.
3. Examine the dogma effects on that card.
4. For each effect:
- a. Demand Effect: Each player (in clockwise order from you) that had less of the featured icon than you must perform the demand.
- b. Non-Demand Effect: Each player (in clockwise order from you) that had at least as many of the featured icon as you must perform the effect.  Then, you perform the effect.
5. If any non-demand effect was shared by an opponent, take a free Draw action.

## What if I can only complete a part of a dogma effect or demand?

Remember: 'Do all you can, ignore the rest!', as explained at the beginning of this FAQ.

## Can I use both of my actions to activate the same card?

Yes, you can activate the same card twice on the same turn.

## Must exchanges always have an equal number of cards?

Exchanges need not be symmetrical. You can exchange one card with none, ten cards with four, or two cards with two.

## What happens if a dogma effect demands specific cards from an opponent's hand (cards of certain color, cards with a certain icon), and he does not have them? Does he need to show me his hand?

Yes, on cards that demand a specific icon or color of card from another player's hand, they need to show you their hand to verify what they didn't give you.

Your play group might want to decide in advance how to handle these situations. Some groups may choose to work on an honor basis, not requiring revealing the hand. Others might play pretty loose with this, just flashing quick enough to show what needs showing, and not taking a bunch of time to catalog exactly what was there. Even if you do want to allow time to inspect the hand's content, the rule of thumb is to keep it quick and not let it delay the game.

Dogmas that say 'Repeat this dogma effect', what is the maximum number of times to repeat the effect?

Continue repeating the effect until the condition specified is no longer fulfilled.

## What if a dogma effect refers to a non existing value? (For example, 'Draw a card of value two higher than the highest card in your score pile', when your score pile is empty)

Non existing values are always considered zero. In this example, you would draw a card of value two higher than zero; a card of value two.

## May I choose to use only a subset of the dogma effects on a card?

No. Once you use a dogma action, all dogma effects on a card must be resolved in order. You may choose not to use 'You may' effects (though opponents sharing the effect can still use it, even if you choose not to!).

## If I demand something of an opponent and he has more than one of the cards that meet the criteria, who chooses which card is affected?

Read the effect aloud! This is further explained at the beginning of the FAQ. In general, opponents make all choices in respect to complying with an I Demand effect. The only exception is Collaboration, and the card clearly states that the attacking player makes the choice.

Several dogma effects instruct you to execute other dogma effects 'for yourself only'. If I in general (for example, the special win conditions cards from age 10), what happens?

execute a dogma effect for myself only, and the dogma effect affects other players or the game The effect happens as instructed. When a dogma effect is executed for 'yourself only', the meaning is that it is not shared. However, if it targets other cards or other players, the effect continues.

## Sharing dogmas

## How does sharing work, exactly?

When activating a dogma as an action, first look at the small icon next to the card's dogma effects. Count the number of this icon in each player's board. Each opponent who has at least that number of icons is sharing the dogma.

Then, go over the dogma effects one after the other. For each one of these effects that is not an I Demand effect, each eligible opponent shares the effect, in turn order. Unless the dogma effect says 'You may', the sharing is mandatory, and the opponent must fulfill it. If a card starts with an I Demand effect and then followed by a non I Demand effect, do not share the I Demand effect, but then do share the non I Demand effect.

The icons are only counted for sharing at the beginning, when activating the dogma. Some cards have multiple dogma effects, and the earlier ones may change the number of icons on the board; you do not recount for sharing purposes. If sharing leads to any changes in the game state, the current player receives a free Draw action.

## Do opponents have to share dogma effects if they have enough icons?

Unless a dogma effect specifically say 'You may', all eligible opponents must share it. This can be an important strategy, as some of these effects may be detrimental to your opponents. Furthermore, forcing opponents to share effects allows you to receive free Draw actions.

## When a card has multiple dogma effects, in which order are they resolved in respect to sharing?

Dogma effects are always resolved in order; this including sharing. For example, let's use Philosophy:

[Lightbulb]: You may splay left any one color of your cards.

[Lightbulb]: You may score a card from your hand.

Amy has Philosophy and three [Lightbulb] icons. Bob has two [Lightbulb] icons, and Chris has five [Lightbulb] icons. Amy activates Philosophy as a dogma action. The first effect is resolved; Chris may splay left any one color of his cards, and then Amy may splay left any one color of her cards. Then, the second effect is resolved; Chris may score a card from his hand, and then Amy may score a card from her hand. Then, if Chris shared any of these effects, Amy receives a free Draw action.

## How are combinations of I Demand and non-I Demand dogmas resolved in respect to sharing?

The important thing to remember is that there are I Demand dogmas and non-I Demand dogmas; there are no I Demand cards or non-I Demand cards. Therefore, treat each dogma in turn, resolving it either as I Demand (granting immunity to opponents with enough icons) or as a shareable dogma (sharing with opponents with enough icons). For example, let's use Oars:

[Castle]: I demand you transfer a card with a [Crown] from your hand to my score pile! If you do, draw a 1!

[Castle]: If no cards were transferred due to this demand, draw a 1.

Amy has Oars and five [Castle] icons. Bob has six [Castle] icons, and Chris has two [Castle] icons. Amy activates Oars. The first effect is resolved; Bob is immune to the I Demand, as he has enough [Castle] icons. Chris must transfer a card with a [Crown] from his hand to Amy's score pile; unfortunately for Amy, he has no such cards in hand. Next, the second effect is resolved. Bob shares the effect; no cards were transferred due to the demand, and therefore he draws a 1. Then, Amy draws a 1. Finally, Amy receives a free Draw action (since Bob shared the dogma).

## My opponent lost icons due to the first dogma effect of a card, and now he cannot share the rest of the card.

Icons are only counted once for the purpose of sharing. You do not recount mid-dogma.

## When a non-demand effect is considered 'shared' for the purpose of receiving a free Draw action?

A 'share' occurs if anything at all happens for your opponent. Even if the game state (boards, hands, score piles and achievements) does not change, but something happened, a 'share' has occurred.

Some examples of when a 'share' does not occur:

- A 'may' effect that has been declined by an opponent.
- Opponent tries to score, meld or tuck a card from hand, and his hand is empty.
- Opponent tries to splay a pile with zero cards or one card in it, or to splay a pile to a direction where it is already splayed.

## Keywords

## How do I score cards? Splay piles? When do I tuck? Are these actions I can take?

Scoring, splaying and tucking are all keywords, not actions. They appear on many dogmas (in fact, most dogmas have at least one of these keywords). When the dogma is activated, you get the relevant effect. You cannot score, splay or tuck without using dogmas.

The highest/the lowest cards

## What is the difference between 'all' the highest/lowest cards, and 'some number' highest/lowest cards?

'All the highest/lowest cards' refers to all cards of one value, which is decided on when the dogma effect occurs. You examine the game area dictated by the dogma effect (score pile, hand or board), and use all of the cards of one age that fit the criterion. For example, if an opponent has a hand with cards from ages 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2; 'all the highest cards' refers to the two age 5 cards. 'All the lowest cards' refers to the single age 2 card.

When a specific number is given, you examine the game area and continue using cards until the number is fulfilled (or the score pile, hand or board is empty). With the hand given above (5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2), the 'three highest cards' will be 5, 5, 4; the 'three lowest cards' will be 2, 3, 3 (and the target chooses which two of the three age 3 cards to give).

## Draw and X

## What if I need to draw and X from an empty pile?

As in a draw action, you draw from the next pile instead.

## What if I need to draw and X several cards at the same time?

You draw and X them in order. This is important for melding and tucking cards.

## Return

## What if I am asked to return a card to an empty pile?

Create a new pile for that age. The pile is reformed for all purposes.

## In which order should I return multiple cards?

Unless specifically stated on the dogma effect, you choose the order in which to return cards.

## Score

## Can I look at the cards in my score pile?

Yes, you can always look at the cards in your score pile.

## Splay

## Can I splay a pile with zero cards or one card?

No, zero/one card piles are never splayed.

## What if I had a pile splayed, and now all of its cards were removed? (Or all cards but one?)

The pile is no longer splayed. Melding or tucking new cards does not re splay the pile; this has to be redone through a dogma effect.

Do I continue splaying if I meld or tuck new cards in a pile?

Yes, you continue the splay in the same direction.

## What happens when I splay a pile which is already splayed?

That depends on whether you're re-splaying to the same direction, or to a new direction. If you're resplaying to the same direction, nothing happened (and the effect is not shared for the purpose of a free Draw action). If you're re-splaying to a new direction, return the pile to its unsplayed position and then splay to the new direction. In other words, splaying is not cumulative.

## Transfer

## What does transfer mean?

Transfer means taking a card from one game area (score pile, hand or board) and putting it in another game area.

Transferring a card to your board means you place the card at the top of its appropriate pile. This is similar to melding the card (although it does not count for the purpose of claiming the Monument

achievement). Likewise, transferring to your score pile is not considered scoring, and transferring to your hand is not considered drawing.

## Tuck

## What if I tuck a card and its color pile is empty?

If there is no pile, the tuck starts a new pile (and the tucked card is at the top of the pile).

## What if I tuck into a splayed pile?

The splay is continued; tuck the card appropriately.

## Special achievements

## Can I claim a special achievement on another player's turn?

Yes, if a shared dogma effect (or complying with an I Demand dogma) puts you in a state where you're allowed to claim a special achievement, you may immediately do so.

## Can I claim a special achievement mid-action?

Yes, special achievements are claimed instantaneously, as soon as you fulfill the requirements.

What if a special achievement can be claimed by more than one player at the same time? Go in turn order, starting with the current player.

What if multiple special achievements can be claimed by more than one player at the same time?

Go in turn order, starting with the current player.

If I tuck three cards and score three cards, can I claim the monument achievement? No. Monument can only be claimed if you tuck six or score six cards (or via the Masonry card).

I just exchanged six cards from my hand to my (empty) score pile; or, I just transferred six cards to my score pile. Can I claim the monument achievement?

No, you must specifically score the cards. Any other keyword will not do.

## Team Innovation (2v2) Official Rules

Note: For your first game, we recommend you play with two or three players. Also, for four players, here is a variant we enjoy:

In Team Innovation, you partner with the player across from you. Victory is claimed by having six achievements between the two of you, or having the higher combined score in the event of someone trying to draw an 11. If a card says that you win, your entire team wins.

I Demand dogma effects ignore your partner completely. Also, cards that refer to 'opponents' or 'other players' ignore your partner.

Non-demand dogma effects are shared by your partner as normal, but if they were the only player to share, you do not get a bonus Draw action.

All other aspects of game play remain the same.

## Card texts and clarifications

The cards list is sorted by age. Within each age, it is sorted in alphabetical value. The icons list is specified in the following order: Top left, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right. Some cards are followed by a list of clarifications.

## Age 1

## Agriculture

Yellow. [Hexagon: a sheaf of grain], [Leaf], [Leaf], [Leaf].

[Leaf]: You may return a card from your hand. If you do, draw and score a card of value one higher than the card you returned.

## Archery

Red. [Castle], [Lightbulb], [Hexagon, bow and arrow], [Castle]. [Castle]: I demand you draw a 1, then transfer the highest card in your hand to my hand!

- Even if an opponent has multiple cards of the lowest age in his hand, only one is transferred.

## City States

Purple. [Hexagon, a courthouse or temple], [Crown], [Crown], [Castle].

[Crown]: I demand you transfer a top card with a [Castle] from your board to my board if you have at least four [Castle] icons on your board! If you do, draw a 1!

- Two conditions need to be met for your opponent to transfer a card with a [Castle] from his board to yours. First, you must have more [Crown] icons than him (this is the standard I Demand requirement). Then, the opponent must have at least four [Castle] icons. This includes icons due to splayed piles.

## Clothing

Green. [Hexagon, a toga], [Crown], [Leaf], [Leaf].

[Leaf]: Meld a card from your hand of different color from any card on your board.

[Leaf]: Draw and score a 1 for each color present on your board not present on any other player's board.

- When scoring, you examine the boards of all other players for colors you have (you do not choose just one player to examine).
- Teammates in a four players game are not opponents and do not count against Clothing.

## Code of Laws

Purple. [Hexagon, two tablets], [Crown], [Crown], [Leaf].

[Crown]: You may tuck a card from your hand of the same color as any card on your board. If you do, you may splay that color of your cards left.

## Domestication

Yellow. [Castle], [Crown], [Hexagon, a bull], [Castle].

[Castle]: Meld the lowest card in your hand. Draw a 1.

## Masonry

Yellow. [Castle], [Hexagon, bricks], [Castle], [Castle].

[Castle]: You may meld any number of cards from your hand, each with a [Castle]. If you melded four or more cards, claim the Monument achievement.

- In order to claim the Monument achievement, all four cards must be melded as part of a single Masonry dogma action. If you split them into two dogma actions (even if they're on the same turn!) you do not claim Monument.
- If an opponent shares the dogma effect and fills the requirements for the special achievement, he will claim it first.

## Metalworking

Red. [Castle], [Castle], [Hexagon, a spear over a shield], [Castle].

[Castle]: Draw and reveal a 1. If it has a [Castle], score it and repeat this dogma effect. Otherwise, keep it.

- You repeat this dogma effect until you draw and reveal a card without a [Castle].
- If you draw and reveal a card without a [Castle], you keep it.

## Mysticism

Purple. [Hexagon, a crescent moon], [Castle], [Castle], [Castle].

[Castle]: Draw a 1. If it is the same color as any card on your board, meld it and draw a 1.

- You only meld and draw again at most once (if the first card is that same color as any card on your board).
- You must reveal the card you draw first, in order to show the other players whether it is the same color as any card on your board or not (as the meld is mandatory).
- If the drawn card is not the same color as any card on your board, keep it.

## Oars

Red. [Castle], [Crown], [Hexagon: a pair of oars], [Castle].

[Castle]: I demand you transfer a card with a [Crown] from your hand to my score pile! If you do, draw a 1.

[Castle]: If no cards were transferred due to this demand, draw a 1.

- If an opponent does not have any cards with a [Crown], he must reveal his hand.
- The second effect is a non-I Demand effect; therefore, it is shared with other players.

## Pottery

Blue. [Hexagon, A pot], [Leaf], [Leaf], [Leaf]. [Leaf]: You may return up to three cards from your hand. If you returned any cards, draw and score a card of value equal to the number of cards you returned. [Leaf]: Draw a 1.

## Sailing

Green. [Crown], [Crown], [Hexagon, a boat], [Leaf]. [Crown]: Draw and meld a 1.

## The Wheel

Green. [Hexagon, a wheel], [Castle], [Castle], [Castle].

[Castle]: Draw two 1.

## Tools

Blue. [Hexagon, a sickle and a hammer], [Lightbulb], [Lightbulb], [Castle]. [Lightbulb]: You may return three cards from your hand. If you do, draw and meld a 3. [Lightbulb]: You may return a 3 from your hand. If you do, draw three 1.

## Writing

Blue. [Hexagon, a writing quill], [Lightbulb], [Lightbulb], [Crown].

[Lightbulb]: Draw a 2.

- The dogma effect specifically draws a 2. Even if you have a higher top card on your board, you still draw a 2 (you only draw a higher age card if the 2 pile is empty).

## Age 2

## Calendar

Blue. [Hexagon, a sundial], [Leaf], [Leaf], [Lightbulb].

[Leaf]: If you have more cards in your score pile than in your hand, draw two 3.

## Canal Building

[Crown]: You may exchange all the highest cards in your hand with all the highest cards in your score

Yellow. [Hexagon, a gondola], [Crown], [Leaf], [Crown]. pile.

- Exchanges need not be of an equal number of cards (and either number could be zero).

## Currency

Green. [Leaf], [Crown], [Hexagon, two ancient coins], [Crown].

[Crown]: You may return any number of cards from your hand. If you do, draw and score a 2 for every different value of card you returned.

- If you return one card, you score one 2 (you do not need to return at least two cards to fulfill this dogma effect).

## Construction

Red. [Castle], [Hexagon, a catapult], [Castle], [Castle].

[Castle]: I demand you transfer two cards from your hand to my hand, then draw a 2! [Castle]: If you are the only player with five top cards, claim the Empire achievement.

- The second effect is a non-I Demand effect; therefore, it is shared with other players.
- If your opponent only transferred zero cards or one card, he still draws a 2.
- If an opponent shares the dogma effect and fills the requirements for the special achievement, he will claim it first.

## Fermenting

Yellow. [Leaf], [Leaf], [Hexagon, a barrel], [Castle]. [Leaf]: Draw a 2 for every two [Leaf] icons on your board.

## Mapmaking

Green. [Hexagon, a treasure map], [Crown], [Crown], [Castle].

[Crown]: I demand you transfer a 1 from your score pile to my score pile.

[Crown]: If any card was transferred due to the demand, draw and score a 1.

- Mapmaking specifically looks for cards of age 1. If an opponent does not have score cards of age 1, you do not transfer any score cards.
- The second effect is a non-I Demand effect; therefore, it is shared with other players.
